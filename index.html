    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Maurin (first name) Gilles (last name). I am currently pursuing my last year as a student at <a href="https://www.isima.fr/en/home/">ISIMA</a>, an engineering school in computer science located in Clermont-Ferrand, France.
        I will graduate in October 2026 and my goal is to pursue a PhD afterwards.
        Before that I need to find an 5-6 months internship from April to September 2026, which I envision as an important step of my just starting career in research.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my academic cursus I specialised in AI, Optimisation, Data Science and Scientific Computing. However, I am driven by a major interest in Humanities - especially Philosophy - and I would like to flavour my research with a touch of interdisciplinarity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The present page is organised as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#csp">Computer Science & Philosophy</a>: a description of my main areas of interest.</li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a>: a presentation of the research projects I have already worked on.</li>
        <li><a href="#mam">More about me</a>: additional personal features and trivia :)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This webpage is a GitHub page powered by my presently very underutilised html/css skills. I try my best to write according to the spelling of my British neighboUrs.
        The background image is the painting "La Leçon au jardin" by Berthe Morisot. (You can admire it scrolling all the way down.)

    <h2 id="csp">Computer Science & Philosophy</h2>

    <h3>Computer Science</h3>

    <p>
        I will not sound original, but I cannot help being fascinated about AI. I am more precisely interested in interdisciplinary subfield of trustworthy AI, which I have only explored by the angle of mechanistic interpretability so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other huge field to appeal to me is Agent-Based Modeling & Simulation. I am particularly intrigued by the concept of emergence which I believe can bring clues to many cross-domain studies - including trustworthy AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tool wise, I am a beloved and convinced preacher for the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>, though my academic background included classes on Python, C++ and Java.
        I managed to get my professers to let me do most of my work labs in Julia, and it allowed me to gain self-taught experience with 
        <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a>,
        <a href="https://fluxml.ai/">flux</a>,
        <a href="https://jump.dev/">JuMP</a>,
        <a href="https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/">JuliaDynamics</a>,
        <a href="https://turinglang.org/">Turing.jl</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ztangent/Julog.jl">Julog.jl</a> and
        <a href="https://docs.makie.org/stable/">Makie</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>

    <p>
        I like to describe myself - somehow provocatively - as a <i>postmodern theological existentialist</i>. By "existentialist" I mean that I find major inspiration in Kierkegaard and Camus - and Sartre to the extent that I am able to understand his work.
        "Theological" because I am deeply influenced by (Reform) Judaism and writings of people such as Delphine Horvilleur, Mark-Alain Ouaknin, and more or less directly by Emmanuel Lévinas.
        "Postmodern", because I think theories on the concept of construction developped by Foucault, Derrida or Butler can (should) be guidelines for the future of social studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to more concrete areas of interest, I am particularly enthusiastic about gender studies. I am also very keen on political philosophy, and my school of thought in this domain is without doubt Gustav Landauer's communitarian libertarian socialism - although I would like to change "communitarian" to "federalist" for my own designation, as I am an active member of the <a href="https://federalists.eu/">Union of European Federalists</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>A few remarks about my position:</b> I do not see in Judaism a guiding light for moral questions, but rather for some metaphysical issues and especially those related to mind and consciousness.
        I think Kierkegaard has been the most inspiring author to me in this respect, even though he was a Christian.
        As regards postmodernism, I have read Sokal and Bricmont's "Intellectual impostures", and I regret the way this criticism has been hijacked (at least in France) to serve dangerous conservative rhetoric.
        I think their concern is valid to a certain extent, and shaky scientific references is a barrier that prevents me from appriciating Preciado's work for example.
        I do not think metaphysical philosophy is pointless, nor that science is able to provide answers to all questions; but clearly the bridge between these two worlds needs to be built very carefully, and it makes interdisicplinary research yet more necessary in my opinion.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>Both?</h3>

    <p>
        The few computer scientists around me to have a little interest in philosophy usually focus on analytic epistemology. Indeed, Gödel and Hilbert have been recurrent protagonists in the logic classes I attended, and they were great help to read Russel's work.
        Unfortunately, as Porco Rosso would rather be a pig than a fascist, I would rather be an engineer than an epistemologist! That being said, I have one or two books from Jules Vuillemin on my booskshelf that wait for me to read them, and I would be happy to let them change my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am way more interested in ontological questions computer science arise and already arose before 2020 AI Boom. The existentialist in me cannot help thinking about the first sentence of the back cover of Sartre's "Being and Nothingness": <i>"L'être ne saurait engendrer que l'être"</i>.
        This claim is to be considered in the context that Sartre gives it, but I still think that some artificial beings - perhaps stochastic automata even more than deterministic deep models - call for further exploration of these ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, I am very interested in fields of trustworthy, ethic and explainable AI, which obviously demand state-of-the-art knowledge and skills on AI, but are also meant to be interdisciplinary in my opinion.
    </p>

    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <h3>LLm-driven agents for psychotherapeutic purposes</h3>

    <p>
        This is one of the two main projects I have been working on during my 5-months internship in the <a href="https://cas.au.dk/en/robophilosophy">Research Unit for Robophilosophy & Integrative Social Robotics</a> (RISR) at Aarhus University, Denmark.
        The most thorough description of the project for the moment is probably part 2 of my <a href="risr_internship_report.pdf">internship report</a>. Hopefully, a real academic paper should be published the day the experiment is actually conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make a long story short: multiple experiments concur proving prosocial behaviours to have a positive influence on one's well-being.
        Other experiments in the field of psychology show that pro-social behaviours can be encouraged thanks to a motivational interview with a professional psychologist.
        The natural next step for a "robophilosophy" group is to study whether the psychologist can be an artificial agent in this motivational session.
        Research suggests this may be possible, espeially with resepect to the agent's level of sociomorphism - notion developped within the RISR research unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        My main contribution to this project was to develop a chatbot for the purpose of this experiment (back, front, and network setting, using Python) and its embodiement into a <a href="https://www.furhatrobotics.com/">Furhat robot</a>, using the Furhat SDK in Kotlin.
    </p>

    <h3>Intention-oriented perspectives for mechanistic interpretability</h3>

    <p>
        This the second major project I worked on during my internship in the <a href="https://cas.au.dk/en/robophilosophy">RISR</a> research group, and a more throgouh description (including a short introduction to neural networks) is available in part 3 of my <a href="risr_internship_report.pdf">internship report</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core idea of the project is to study the <a href="https://spawn-queue.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3236386.3241340">AI explainability</a> problem from an angle focusing on the notion of intention.
        In particular, we are interested in eximining if and how <a href="https://hal.science/ijn_00353954v1">Elisabeth Pacherie's model of intention in action</a> can provide a relevant framework for theorical research on explainability.
        Our early work suggests that this goal may well associate with <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary">mechanistic interpretability</a>, a subfield of explainability that aims to understand trained model through an <i>a posteriori</i> analysis of its parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        My internship was too short to start any concrete work, but I find the ideas we brought on the table fascinating and I intend to work this project further one day.
    </p>


    <h3>Dynamic query optimisation in data integration systems</h3>

    <p>
        This project was part of a research initiation programme I attended during my second year at ISIMA. It led to <a href="dynamic_query_opti_dis.pdf">this paper</a> which is not to be published itself, but will probably be a basis for a future work by my supervisor.
        Compared to other research projects I worked on, this one falls in a very technical field of computer science that is query optimisation, which is hard to introduce without giving a whole course on the topic.
        The following abstract may therefore sound obnoxiously fuzzy for someone outside the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Query optimisation in Database Management Systems relies on statistics about data distribution in the sources to estimate an optimal plan to execute a query.
        In data integration, such statistics are often not available, and alternative techniques should be considered.
        The most efficient solutions in this field tend to have "dynamic" approaches, in which the missing statistics are computed during the query execution, in order to find a better plan to switch to during runtime.
        In this work, we have an overview of the issues and solutions existing for dynamic query optimisation in data integration systems.
        We focus more precisely on the join ordering problem, and how to estimate joins without initial knowledge on the sources.
        We propose a solution involving dynamic histograms, which provide decent estimates in this very constrained context.
    </p>

    <h3>Perpetual triangular grid exploration by a swarm of luminous robots</h3>

    <p>
        This is an ongoing project I work on as part of my master's degree, for which I will have written a report by the end of March 2026. For curious minds, I have nothing better to offer than <a href="m2ics_proposal.pdf">this (incomplete) introduction</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By "triangular" grid, one can think of a regular tilting with equilateral triangles, and construct a finite graph taking a convex set of points located at the intersections as vertices, and their induced edges.
        In a theorical model, the robots are visiting a vertex at any point in time, and can move along one edge at each step of time. Solving the perpetual exploration problem means to find an algorithm where the sequence of positions of the robots on the grid is a cycle during which each vertex is visited at least once.
        Robots are luminous: they have a colour, can change its colour, and can identify colours of other robots within a certain distance. 
        Colours are the only mean robots possess to communicate. To develop an algorithm means to define a set of rules embedded by the robots to solve the perpetual exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of our work on this project is to find optimal algorithms with respect to different parameters (number of robots, number of colours, vissibility range, robots' ability to orientate themselves), which implies to prove these algorithms sound, complete and optimal.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mam">More about me</h2>
    <p>I was born in 2003 in Marseille, the most beautiful, exciting, vibrant, multicultural, and second largest city in France. Since 2019 I live in the charming yet slightly more boring Auvergne region.</p>
    <p>I like to cook, although I eat vegetarian (with rare exceptions) and am therefore not good at most French specialities... I am also a wine enjoyer, always up for a bottle of Madiran or Crozes-Hermitage.</p>
    <p>I play guitar ad bass at an extremely amateur level, but I would like to seriously learn trumpet one day. On the listener side, I am mainly into French folk, jazz, opera and "classical" music, with a special burning love for Mendelssohn and Purcell.</p>
    <p>My main hobby besides reading is cinema. For the four last years, I volunteered during <a href="https://clermont-filmfest.org/en/global/home/">Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival</a>, the largest short-film festival in the world, that happens to take place in the city in which I study.</p>
    <p>I am openly queer, and secretly a drag queen. I like to mix pronouns in my activist life, but casually use he/him.</p>
    <p>I use Arch btw.</p>
